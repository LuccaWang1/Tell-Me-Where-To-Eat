## Project Description 
Tell Me Where To Eat provides a solution to psychological analysis paralysis and simplifying dinner decision making. 

The web app does this by allowing someone to select a type of food they are craving for their meal, or the user can leave that selection blank (not selecting a type of food), and the app will select an eatery (just one) for the person for their next meal from datasets of eateries. 

The full stack project was built and architected solely by Lucca Wang, who created the app from scratch, developing with Python, Flask, and JavaScript.

*Users can select a type of food from the dropdown menu.*

### Technologies Used  
* Python (server, backend logic)
* Flask (Python framework)
* JavaScript (frontend)
* Python's random module (in server used in backend logic) 
* Datasets of real eateries (py file, imported into server for backend logic)
* CSS (frontend, styling)
* HTML (homepage template, rendered by Flask)

*When the user hovers over the button, there is a visual clue that occurs with CSS - the button turns the darker blue color and the usual colors are inverted.*

### Accessibility
Aspects of accessibility for everyone, including those with disabilities, were considered while making this project:
* ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes help improve accessibility by providing additional context and cues to assistive technologies.
* The colors are of high contrast to each other, so that people can more easily read and intake the information on the screen. It's a dark font color on a light background. It meets ADA regulations for high color contrast. 
* The font size is large (over 19px) to enable high readability. The font size exceeds ADA recommendations for website font size.
* All the text is of the same font size and style throughout the app for readability. 
* The drop down menu of items to select is the same font size as the rest of the text on the page for cohesion, consistency, and readability. 
* Everything is left aligned for readability.

*After selecting a type and clicking the button, a single eatery is placed in the div placeholder.*
