# Tell Me Where To Eat

### Project Description 
Tell Me Where To Eat provides a solution to psychological analysis paralysis and simplifying dinner decision making. 

The web app does this by allowing someone to select a type of food they are craving for their meal, or the user can leave that selection blank (not selecting a type of food), and the app will select an eatery (just one) for the person for their next meal from datasets of eateries. 

The full stack project was built and architected solely by Lucca Wang, who created the app from scratch, developing with Python, Flask, and JavaScript.

### Technologies Used  
* Python
* Flask 
* JavaScript
* Python's random module

* CSS
* HTML  

### Author
