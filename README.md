# Let's Eat

![Let's Eat app by Lucca Wang](/static/images/readme_markdown/LetsEat-webapp.gif)

## Project Description 
__Let's Eat__ provides a solution to psychological analysis paralysis (the pyschology term for when we have too many options that we freeze without being able to choose one). Simply put, __this app helps you decide where to eat quickly, with a click of a button!__

The user selects a type of food, or can chose not to select a type of food. 

The app then selects an eatery from provided datasets of eateries and outputs one eatery as the result, which is placed into a div shown in the viewport. 

This is a full-stack project built and architected by Lucca Wang. 

Wang built the app from scratch, developing with __Python, Flask, JavaScript, Google Font API__, and more.

## Snapshot of Project

* Full-stack web app built from scratch, providing a solution to psychological analysis paralysis, simplifying decision making.

* Dynamic content generation with Python's random module and logic. 

* Uses accessibility with skip navigation, ARIA, and exceeding ADA requirements.

* Utilizes Python's framework Flask for template (webpage) rendering, JavaScript's event listening actions, and an API to enhance the font style and family.

### Accessibility
* There is a __skip navigation__ feature that's visually hidden but accessible to screen readers. Users who navigate the site using screen readers or keyboard shortcuts can use the link to jump directly to the main content area, improving their browser experience. 

* __ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)__ attributes help improve accessibility by providing additional context and cues to assistive technologies.

* The colors are of __high contrast__ to each other, so that people can more easily read and intake the information on the screen. It's a dark font color on a light background. It meets ADA requirements for high color contrast. 

* The __font size__ is large (over 19px) to enable high readability. The font size __meets ADA requirements__ and exceeds the recommendations for website font size.

* All the text is of the same font size and style throughout the app for __cohesion, consistency, and readability__. 

* The dropdown menu of items to select is the same font size as the rest of the text on the page for __cohesion, consistency, and readability__.

* All images in this documentation have captions also for accessibility purposes.
